% This script assumes these variables are defined:
%
%   InputAllEdited - input data.
%   OutputAllEdited - target data.

x = InputAllEdited';
t = OutputAllEdited';

% Choose a Training Function
% For a list of all training functions type: help nntrain
% 'trainlm' is usually fastest.
% 'trainbr' takes longer but may be better for challenging problems.
% 'trainscg' uses less memory. NFTOOL falls back to this in low memory situations.
trainFcn = 'trainbr';  % Bayesian Regularization

% Create a Fitting Network
hiddenLayerSize = 10;
net = fitnet(hiddenLayerSize,trainFcn);

% Setup Division of Data for Training, Validation, Testing
net.divideParam.trainRatio = 80/100;
net.divideParam.valRatio = 10/100;
net.divideParam.testRatio = 10/100;

% Train the Network
[net,tr] = train(net,x,t);

% Test the Network
y = net(x);
e = gsubtract(t,y);
performance = perform(net,t,y)

% View the Network
